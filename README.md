# lithology_prediction_using_machine_learning

This repository contains code to predict lithology from wireline log. 
Algorithm that used here is random forest. Yet another improvement could be done by applying deep learning (to be added once the author finished with her new model).

Folder structured:
* Data :
  - images from several wells were provided as visualisation.
  - Wireline data in LAS format from 118 wells.
  - Labeled lithology from all wells are available with this code:

* code : contains .py file that contains all functions to run the prediction model
* notebooks : contains jupyter notebook that demonstrate how to predict the lithology from wireline log.
* requirements : contains libraries that you needed to run the program.
* README.md : contains all explanation about this project.
